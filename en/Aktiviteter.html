        <h2>Organic bicycle vacation</h2><p>2 days, 31 km (19 miles)</p>
        
    	<p>This tour will give you a completely organic vacation. Enjoy the simple things in life, beautiful nature and of course the canal! You will be visiting the café «Visthuset» in Töreboda and the organic hostel in the scenic village Tåtorp. Both places put the well-being of people and the environment first. The lock in Tåtorp is the only manually operated one on the whole western route of the canal wich makes it even more intresting to observe the art of locking a boat. 
<br><br>
On your way to Tåtorp, you will pass by a large obelisk wich marks the highest lant spot along the «Göta Canal», called «Lanthöjden». This is a good spot to enjoy the picnic basket, that you will receive from us. At the hostel in Tåtorp you will spent the night in organically produced sheets. From here it is not far to several beautiful bathing spots and the pretty garden of the hostel gives you time to relax and be yourself. Here you also have the possibility to rent a boat and try your fishing luck in the lake «Viken».</p>
        <p>
       The tour starts in Töreboda where you will collect your bike at café «Visthuset». You will also receive your picnic basket that you can enjoy whenever you like. The way will lead you towards Tåtorp and you will be riding easily on plain gravel paths alongside the canal and through fields. These paths are the very same that in earlier days were used by the draft oxen, wich were pulling the freight boats up and down the «Göta Canal». In Tåtorp you will check in at the hostel were your dinner will be served. On the way to Tåtorp you will pass by «Wassbacken». On some summer nights live music is played here which can be a nice way to end the day.</p>
        <p>
           After you've had breakfast, you will be cycling back to Töreboda in your own pace. At the café «Visthuset» a delicious «Smörgåsbricka» - a cold platter with local specialities - awaits you.
